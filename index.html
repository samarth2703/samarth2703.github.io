<!-- ABOUT -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a technology enthusiast with a strong inclination toward security-oriented
    development, programming, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy breaking down
    complex systems to understand how they work internally and then using that
    knowledge to build smarter, safer solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    My learning approach is hands-on, project-driven, and focused on real-world
    relevance rather than theory alone. I am particularly interested in how AI,
    cybersecurity, and system-level programming intersect.
